Join us on May 11 at Walter Payton College Prep for Code.Chi, a conference for high school girls all around Chicago who are interested in pursuing a future in tech. It is a great place for girls with shared interests to come together and meet women with a variety of backgrounds in the industry. The conference includes speakers from different areas of tech, a panel of women in tech, and hands-on workshops where attendees can learn new skills. Code.Chi was founded in 2018 and is completely student-organized. Register online, or contact us with any questions! We hope to see you there!
