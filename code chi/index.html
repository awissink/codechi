  <p>Join us on <strong>February 22</strong> at Walter Payton College Prep for <strong>Code.Chi</strong>, a conference for female-identifying
    high school students all around Chicago who are interested in pursuing a future in tech. It is a great place
    for students with shared interests to come together and meet women with a variety of backgrounds in the industry.
      The conference includes speakers from different areas of tech, a panel of women in tech, and hands-on
       workshops where attendees can learn new skills. Code.Chi was founded in 2018 and is completely
       student-organized. Register online, or contact us with any questions! We hope to see you there!</p>
