I am an Engineering Manager at Trunk Club. I have a bachelors degree from Brown University in International Relations. I have been in the software industry for over a decade, starting as a Test  Apprentice at Microsoft.  In 2016, I moved to Chicago,  did a short stint and Groupon and shortly after accepted a position at Trunk Club. Since joining, I've created the software testing team and recently created the company’s first Test Apprenticeship position (bringing it all full circle/Paying it forward). I'm passionate about youth education in underserved communities. I have served on the board of Child Care Resources (WA), River City Community Development Center(IL) and Young Life West Chicago(IL). Recently I took a break from non profit involvement to focus on my growing family. I have an 11 month old son and am expecting.
