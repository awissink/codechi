		<strong>Julia Fairbank; Panelist</strong> <br>
		Julia Fairbank is a sophomore at Middlebury College where she studies computer science alongside philosophy.
		In high school, Julia worked on a computational genetic lab team through Duke University where she built
		RNA models, analyzed different potential drug docking points, ran thousands of drug candidates against those
		regions, and compared results to pattern match what makes a success dock. She chose to continue in STEM by
		majoring in computer science but chose to supplement it with philosophy which allows her to study both hard
		and soft logical reasoning. Julia will be working for a private equity firm this coming summer, PeakSpan Capital,
		which partners and invests in growth-stage software companies. She is Chicago raised and loves sailing on the lake.
