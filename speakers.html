		<strong>Corine Normandin; Panelist</strong> <br>
		Hi! My name is Corine Normandin and I’m a sophomore at DePaul University studying Cyber Security.
		I am from a small town in New Jersey. I was first introduced to Cyber Security in high school where
		I took entry level cyber security and computer science classes. In the future, I hope to either work
		in digital forensics or in an administrative program to help get women involved in different cyber careers.

		<strong>Olivia Gallager; Panelist</strong> <br>
		I am a junior studying computer science at Northwestern University. I am originally from Brooklyn, NY and
began coding in high school. I work in a prototyping lab and I am interested in how to create technologies
 that are based in human centered design. I have previous coursework in Chemical Engineering and sustainability
and the politics of technology.

		<strong>Norina Mae Balderas; Panelist and Workshop Leader</strong> <br>
		I am a junior at Illinois Institute of Technology where I am studying Electrical Engineering.
		During my time in college, I have been the electrical lead for my IIT's NASA Robotic Mining
		Competition (RMC) team, along with being a part of SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers). Last
		summer I worked for IIT's Computer Discovery Camp, where we taught middle school and high school
		girls the basic concepts of coding through Lego Mindstorms, and introduced database with the use
		of SQL through DB Browser. In my free time, however, I love to play video games, watch Twitch streams,
		and learn about future and current technology.

	<strong>Maggie Barclay; Panelist and Workshop Leader</strong><br>
	My name is Maggie Barclay and I’m in my second year at Illinois Institute of
Technology pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Artificial Intelligence. I’m most interested
in the areas of Computer Science involving image processing, computer vision, and
machine learning. My passion for tech started in high school when I joined my first
robotics team, and I’ve been learning ever since. While at IIT, I’ve been heavily involved
in the NASA Robotics Mining Competition team, leading public outreach as well as
project managing as a systems engineer. I strive to share my excitement for science
and technology with younger students, and I’ve had the opportunity to be an instructor
at IIT’s Computer Discovery Camp where we taught both Database and Lego
Mindstorm curricula to young girls. Besides technology, my other interests include
illustration, graphic design, and writing.
