		<strong>Corine Normandin; Panelist</strong> <br>
		Hi! My name is Corine Normandin and Iâ€™m a sophomore at DePaul University studying Cyber Security.
		I am from a small town in New Jersey. I was first introduced to Cyber Security in high school where
		I took entry level cyber security and computer science classes. In the future, I hope to either work
		in digital forensics or in an administrative program to help get women involved in different cyber careers.

		<strong>Norina Mae Balderas; Workshop Leader</strong> <br>
		I am a junior at Illinois Institute of Technology where I am studying Electrical Engineering.
		During my time in college, I have been the electrical lead for my IIT's NASA Robotic Mining
		Competition (RMC) team, along with being a part of SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers). Last
		summer I worked for IIT's Computer Discovery Camp, where we taught middle school and high school
		girls the basic concepts of coding through Lego Mindstorms, and introduced database with the use
		of SQL through DB Browser. In my free time, however, I love to play video games, watch Twitch streams,
		and learn about future and current technology.
