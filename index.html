    female-identifying high school students all around Chicago who are interested in pursuing a future in tech.Code.Chi is a great
    place for students with shared interests to come together and meet women with a variety of backgrounds in the industry. The
    conference includes speakers from different areas of tech, a panel of students in tech, and hands-on workshops where attendees can
    learn new skills. Code.Chi was founded in 2018 and is completely student-organized by Walter Payton College Prep juniors and seniors.
